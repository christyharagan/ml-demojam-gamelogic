Overview

Provides an easy to use command line interface for building and deploying MarkScript projects

Usage
--

Install:
```
npm install -g markscript-project
```

Basic Usage:

For TypeScript projects, create a ```markscriptfile.ts``` (for TypeScript projects) or ```markscriptfile.js``` (for JavaScript projects) in your project root (see the [examples folder](https://github.com/christyharagan/markscript-project/examples) for examples of these files).

Then, to build and deploy (or undeploy) the MarkScript project, use the ```msp``` command. Just type ```msp``` from the command line for help.

TypeScript definitions for Marklogic's JavaScript APIs

Note: These currently only work for Marklogic 1.0.2 and the server.d.ts is far from complete

Usage

npm install ml-typescript-definitions
```

Basic Usage:

These are just d.ts files.

Use client.d.ts for the node.js bindings and server.d.ts for server-side javascript.
